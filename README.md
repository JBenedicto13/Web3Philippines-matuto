Matuto is a simple chromium-based browser extension that provides a glossary of terms and definitions related to web3, blockchain and cryptocurrencies when every time you open a new tab from your browser.

It's a Filipino word which means "to learn". Which is the goal of this project, to help people learn more about web3, blockchain and cryptocurrencies. 💜💙📖
