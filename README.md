Matuto is a simple and effective supplementary tool for learning Web3. With Matuto, you can passively learn about Web3 every time you open a new tab in your browser. 💜💙💡

## 💻 Development

1. Install the packages:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build the extension:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

3. Turn on development mode in your browser and load the extension from the `dist` directory.

> **Note**: Everytime you made changes please run `yarn build` to update the extension. Go to extension management page in your browser and reload the extension.
>
> We'll think of a better way to automate this process in the future.
>
> Firefox is not yet supported, test it only on chromium based browser such as Edge or Chrome.
